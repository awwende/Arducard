The arduino business card

The Arducard is released under the creative commons license, feel free to use as is or change to your heart's content, all that is asked is that the hardware and software is kept open source for the benefit of others.

Before sending the files off to the fab house, make sure you replace "Your Name, phone number, email" with your contact information and the introduction text of the code should be personalized as well starting at line 94. The code should work on any Arduino bootloader for the ATMEGA328P or Mega. Due to file size and SRAM requirements, this software will not work (to the best of my knowledge) as it currently is on any of the ATTiny devices.
